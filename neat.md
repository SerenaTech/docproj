# Personal Data Servers (PDS) #
Personal Data Servers (PDSes) host user repositories and their associated media. They also serve as the network access point for users, facilitating repository updates, backups, data queries, and user requests.[5]
Platform clients access the protocol on the user's behalf by querying their PDS, which, in turn, fetches the requested data from other services within the network. This design differs from ActivityPub, where protocol interactions and services are handled by monolithic host servers. Since network events are resolved through the protocol's network-wide indexing infrastructure, the availability of any single PDS is, by design, potentially inconsequential to the user experience.[23]
The AT Protocol prioritizes data portability, enabling users to back up and migrate repositories and associated media without data loss, even in the event of an adversarial PDS.[24] The design of PDSes within the protocol results in low computational requirements for operation, allowing individuals or groups to run their own PDSes without the need for significant computational resources.[3]
